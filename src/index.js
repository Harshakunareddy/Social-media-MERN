// state = it is the plain js object.
// it is read-only.
// cant directly modify it.
// using the dispatch acions we can make changes.

// actions = events or changes in our application

// reducers = pure functions that specify how the state should change in res to actions.
//            it takes current state and an action and return the new state.
//            we can combine multiple reducers to one single reducer using the combineReducers function.

// dispatch = to update the state we dispatch the actions to the redux store using the dispatch method.
//            the store then calculates the new state based on the action.

// subscribing to store = components can subscribe to the store to be able to notify that whenever the state changes.
//                        connect function is used to connect or subscribe react components to the redux store.
